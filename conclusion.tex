\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented MBFQ, a measurement-based fair queuing model for allocating bandwidth to virtual machines.
MBFQ's two-tier scheduling model is scalable across multiple processors.  MBFQ provides weighted
fairness among virtual machines without any specific knowledge of the NIC.  Our implementation 
of MBFQ in Windows is a standard NDIS filter driver that can reside in any part of the networking stack.  Our evaluation
on Windows Server 2016 shows that MBFQ can allocate fair bandwidth sharing among VMs of different weights. It
responds quickly to changes in bandwidth demands among VMs with minimum CPU overhead.  An implementation of 
MBFQ is available with Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview.
