\section{CPU Utilization}
\label{sec:utilization}

We measure the CPU overhead of MBFQ for the setup in Section~\ref{sec:fairshare}
by comparing the CPU utilization of that setup to the CPU utilization of a base scenario
without MBFQ.  

For the base scenario, we assign static rate limits to VM1, VM2, VM3, and VM4 with 
226Mbps, 226Mbps, 2.26Gbps, 
and 6.79Gbps respectively.  These are the rates that MBFQ dynamically distributes  to
the VMs when all VMs are active.

With all VMs active, the CPU utilization of the base scenario is 22.74\%, and CPU utilization
for the MBFQ setup is 23.22\%. This shows that MBFQ has minimum CPU overhead.
